| 🔓 Gateway exposed to public | Anyone can access your AI assistant | Critical |
| 🔑 Weak or leaked token | API keys stolen, unexpected charges | Severe |
| 📷 Camera/screen accessible | Privacy compromised | Severe |
| 💾 Full Disk Access granted | All files accessible | High Risk |
| 🌐 IP in leak database | Already targeted by hackers | High Risk |

**Statistics show 220,000+ OpenClaw instances are exposed publicly. Many API keys have already been leaked.**
